					<p>Hello my name is Tyler Dickard and I am currently a Junior Software Engineering Major 
						At Bowling Green State University. On Campus I am involved with the Falcon Marching Band 
						And I work with the Thompson Scholarship Program to help my community with community service 
						Ever since I was in middle school I have been facinated with developing software and just tinkering
					    with computers, so I feel as if this career path is right for me</p>
