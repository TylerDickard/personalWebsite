				Hello! Thank you for checking out my personal portfolio website! My name is Tyler Dickard and I am currently a Senior at Bowling Green State University
				with a major in Software Engineering and a Minor in General Science. I am currently looking for positions in Front End Development, Full Stack Development, and Software Engineering.
				Outside of my studies I am involved with the Bowden-Thomposon Working Families Scholarship by getting involved in different community service projects. Also, I am the Tenor Drum Section Leader in the BGSU Falcon Marching Band.

						During my time at this internship I worked in the End User Engineering team in the Infrastructure Engineering Department. The project I was tasked with for the summer was Laptop/Hardware
						Refresh Automation. In short, I looked at the current process used at Medical Mutual and found ways to improve the efficiency, and automate tasks that were repetitive. For my individual projects
						I focused on two painpoints of the project, which were: large outlook datafiles taking an extremely long time to transfer for remote workers, and the logging and management of the refresh tickets
						was extremely tedious and several parts of the process can be automated. Here is a quick description of what I did:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Outlook Data File Copy Script
								<ul>
									<li>
										This script was able to automatically detect the file in two common save locations.
									</li>
									<li>
										When the file was detected, it had the capability to split files, compress them, upload to OneDrive, and then decompress and recreate the origional File
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Hardware Refresh Build Log Manager
								<ul>
									<li>
										This project was a web application, which relies upon HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 5.
									</li>
									<li>
										There were tables which had the ability to add, edit, delete, and select rows of data. To implement this I used jQuery's DataTables plugin.
									</li>
									<li>
										This application was able to generate labels needed for managing the refreshes physically.
									</li>
									<li>
										Also, one of the key features of this project is that it had the ability to query a SQL database to pull software information needed to compare the old devices software
										to the new devices installed software.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						During my time at this position I was able to provide several customers with a fast and friendly checkout experience. Throughout my career I worked several different shifts and learned the in's and out's of each. 
						I also was trained in our new Pickup Program, and was able to meet several corperate standards for my position. Towards the end of my career I was able to assist in the repair/maintenence of the registers.

						This position was my first experience in the IT field and gave me a hands-on-experience with repairing computers, upgrading computers, installing new computers, patching cables, and imaging computers.
						Throughout my time at W-E Schools I learned a lot of valuable information and one my most notible projects was during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic when I was tasked with testing a script which automatically 
						set up around 500-600 chromebooks for deployment across the district. With this project I was given a month deadline to complete this task and within 2 weeks I reached the goal set and was able to aid 500-600 students
						in need of a laptop for remote classrooms.
